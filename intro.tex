\section{Introduction}

The agencies have provided a set of requirements for data security which are addressed in this upgrade plan.  This document addresses the upgrades specifically and will augment the overall security plan for Rubin observatory (see \citeds{LDM-324}).
This document addresses the specific requirements given to us by the agencies.

A summary of requirements are :
\begin{enumerate}

\item	Encrypt data following NIST .
\item	Use firewalls to prevent unauthorized  access.
\item	Hold focal plane scientific data for at least 80 hours following the observation. Hold engineering and commissioning imaging data for at least 30 days.
\item	Do not alert on artificial Earth-orbiting satellites.
\item	Check some alerts in a separate facility that has access to appropriate satellite catalogs.
\item	Publish the survey schedule 24 hours in advance.
\item	Request approval for use  without sidereal tracking.

\end{enumerate}


\secref{sec:resp} provides a subsection response for each of these bullets.
