\subsection{Delay public release} \label{sec:3delay}

We feel the best approach here is to keep the embargoed data on a secure device separate from other systems and migrate images to the regular repository as they become \emph{public}.
This can be an object store with encryption like MinIO \footnote{\url{ https://min.io/product/enterprise-object-storage-encryption}}.
We will need to have one at SLAC and one at Chile for redundancy to ensure no data loss.

With the commissioning constraint that means this needs to be a 30 day store  for Full images and engineering data looking at \citeds{DMTN-135}
table table 40 this comes out to about 500TB of usable disk.
\tabref{tab:delay} gives the cost calculation or this.
