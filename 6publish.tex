\subsection{Publish nominal schedule} \label{sec:6publish}

The project was already planning to publish the observing schedule to allow co observing of sources, see Section 2.1 of \citeds{LSE-30}.
The OSS requires  publication at least two  hours ahead of observing - the request here is to have the schedule twenty four hours in advance.
This is not a problem as long as one understands the fidelity of the schedule decreases with the look ahead time.
The agency requirement acknowledges this.

The schedule is to be delivered to the trusted broker - we shall arrange this with LLNL.

We consider no delta cost for this as it was in the project plan.
