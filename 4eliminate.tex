\subsection{Eliminate earth orbiting satellites} \label{sec:4eliminate}

Rubin does not publish alerts for streaks associated with artificial satellites.
A subset of streaks, potentially consistent with Earth-orbiting satellites or Solar System objects, will be evaluated by the \gls{AVS}.
AVS is under discussion currently in terms of design and how it may be implemented.
The cost here is based on FTE  and non labor after initial discussions with \gls{LLNL}.
They are assuming a high availability service.
An estimate is given in \tabref{tab:eliminate}. This also includes the current value in the operations plan.
The cost of delaying the data in an encrypted store is already covered in \secref{sec:3delay}
