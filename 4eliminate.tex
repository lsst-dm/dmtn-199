\subsection{Eliminate earth orbiting satellites} \label{sec:4eliminate}

Rubin does not publish alerts for streaks obviously created by artificial satellites.
A subset of streaks, potentially consistent with Earth-orbiting satellites or Solar System objects, will be evaluated by the AVS.
AVS is under discussion currently in terms of design and how it may be implemented.
The cost here is mainly FTE related the current OPS plan contains 2.5 FTE for this work.
There is an unknown hardware aspect here - assuming a database already exists a fast front end server will still be needed with
some redundancy.
The cost of delaying the data in an encrypted store is already covered in \secref{sec:3delay}
An estimate is given in \tabref{tab:eliminate}.
