\subsection{Eliminate earth orbiting satellites} \label{sec:4eliminate}

Rubin does not publish alerts for streaks associated with artificial satellites.
A subset of streaks, potentially consistent with Earth-orbiting satellites or Solar System objects, will be evaluated by the AVS.
AVS is under discussion currently in terms of design and how it may be implemented.
The cost here is based on FTE  and non labor after initial discussions with LLNL.
They are assuming a high availability service.
The cost of delaying the data in an encrypted store is already covered in \secref{sec:3delay}
An estimate is given in \tabref{tab:eliminate}.
