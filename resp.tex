\section{Response to the requirements}\label{sec:resp}

This plan follows the applicable elements of \citeds{NIST.SP.800-171}. The application of this standard to the Rubin Observatory requires some interpretation. A compliance matrix is provided in \appref{sec:compliance}.
In this matrix and in this document we assume the requirements apply to embargoed images before release to the collaboration and the derived difference image sources.
Hence it applies to Prompt Processing, the embargoed data store(s), and the summit in Chile. It does not apply to DACs nor the actual alert stream.

The non-recurring costs in this plan include necessary end-equipment to manage the data entering the USDF. The incrimental operating costs at the USDF, expecting that they too will follow NIST 800-171, are provided in this document as reference.

From Section 2.1 of \citeds{NIST.SP.800-171} we note that the confidentiality impact value for the data  is no less than moderate.
So we may assume our \citeds{FIPS200} security category would be \{ moderate, low, low\}\footnote{\{confidentiality, availability, integrity\}}.
