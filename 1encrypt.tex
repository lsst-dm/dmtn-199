\subsection{Encrypt Data} \label{sec:1encrypt}

As outlined in \citeds{DMTN-108}  we propose to buy four routers which can perform AES IPSec 256 bit encryption between Chile and SLAC.
We will not transfer embargoed images to France - hence we should keep an secure data store at Chile and at SLAC for redundancy.
Cost here is base on a quotation from Cisco as one of the vendors explicitly specified in the agency document.

See \tabref{tab:ipsec} for the cost breakdown.
