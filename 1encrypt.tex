\subsection{Encrypt Data} \label{sec:1encrypt}

As outlined in \citeds{DMTN-108}  we shall buy four routers which can perform \gls{IPsec} AES-256 bit encryption between Chile and SLAC.
We will not transfer embargoed images to France - hence we should keep a secure data store at Chile and at \gls{SLAC} for redundancy.
The router cost in \tabref{tab:ipsec}  is based on a quotation from Cisco as one of the vendors explicitly specified in the agency document.
While we have shown that \gls{TLS} with AES-256 can provide sufficient performance to meet our Alert timing budget, we have not yet measured performance with the specified routers using IPsec.
We assume that performance will be adequate.

NIST also suggests out of band access - an independent network for access to the \gls{Summit} systems in case the main network is down.
A quote for Telconor to give a backup control link is included in \tabref{tab:ipsec}.

See \tabref{tab:ipsec} for the cost breakdown.  The \gls{OOB} access is in Chile only and the routers and cabling are an even split.
