\subsection{Encrypt Data} \label{sec:1encrypt}

As outlined in \citeds{DMTN-108}  we propose to buy four routers which can perform AES IPSec 256 bit encryption between Chile and SLAC.
We will not transfer embargoed images to France - hence we should keep a secure data store at Chile and at SLAC for redundancy.
The router cost in \tabref{tab:sec}  is based on a quotation from Cisco as one of the vendors explicitly specified in the agency document.

NIST also suggests out of band access - an independent network for alerts in case the main network is down.
A quote for Telconor to give a backup control link is included in \tabref{tab:ipsec}.

See \tabref{tab:ipsec} for the cost breakdown.  The OOB access is in Chile only and the routers and cabling are an even split.
