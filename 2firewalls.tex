\subsection{Install Firewalls and other physical security devices} \label{sec:2firewalls}

This requirement is for physical and cyber security. It includes installing cameras and locks on racks.
Some of this such as Firewalls is already in the project plan but much of it is not.

Items already in the plan:
\begin{itemize}
\item Card access to server rooms.
\item Backup network in case main link fails (though the microwave link is a new addition ..)
\item Auditable process to handle onboarding/offboarding
\item Some cameras are in the project but not complete coverage.

\end{itemize}

We will do as requested and cost estimates are provided in \tabref{tab:firewalls}.

{\bf Important Note}: We shall ring fence the Camera in its own firewall with more restricted access than the restricted control network.
However we will treat it as a black box deliverable for this requirement. We shall not expect encryption of the internal disks of the camera system. Any perturbation to the camera system tends to extend the project baseline.

I am not sure how to cost signage and labeling as required in NIST 171 3.8.4 \footnote{\url{https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf}}

NIST 1.7.1 Section 3.10.6 pulls in extra standards for remote work namely \citeds{nist800-46} and \citeds{nist800-114}.
\citeds{nist800-114} is the broader scope and we are pretty much in line with how it is written - we note Section 5.2.1 that we use Onepassword as a vault for IT passwords - not paper in a fire proof safe as recommended.
Some other suggestions are understood to be useful in general but often not suitable for developers - personal firewalls, application filtering  and aggressive antivirus software often trip over developer code and tools.

Since these documents were written  as guidance we will take note of them but may not always follow all recommendations in all cases.
\citeds{nist800-46} and other NIST documentation suggest threat modeling - we do this in a limited way e.g \citeds{SQR-041} and \citeds{SQR-037}. A more exhaustive risk assessment may be best done by a third party. We should discuss with SLAC.
We do not store sensitive information on the VPN nor bastion nodes.
We do use NAT in a limited number of places - this will be more important in operations if/when we move to IPv6.

We need to cost security contracts, its a hot area and can be expensive.
It is estimated running a SOC could cost upward of \$1.4M per year\footnote{\url{https://expel.io/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-24x7-soc/}}.
This article\footnote{\url{https://www.linkbynet.com/outsourced-soc-vs-internal-soc-how-to-choose}} outlines the pros and cons of
an outsourced SOC and estimates it at between 300 and 800K per year.
For costing purposed  \$40K a month was put in \tabref{tab:firewalls}.
Such a contract (or contracts) should cover:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Proactive monitoring and alerting (NIST 171 section 3.3.5)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Write alerts for suspicious behaviors
  \item Analyze collected logs for anomalies
  \end{itemize}
\item Root cause analysis of any alert or anomaly
\item Incident response
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Isolation of attacker
  \item Forensic analysis leading to timeline and inventory of compromise
  \item Identifying systems that will need to be rebuilt
  \end{itemize}
\item Vulnerability scanning including filtering out false positives
\item Asset inventory including patch status
\item Penetration testing to proactively look for vulnerabilities
\end{enumerate}

This will require extensive coordination and integration with existing IT
services and processes, included as part of this cost.
