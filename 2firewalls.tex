\subsection{Install Firewalls and other physical security devices} \label{sec:2firewalls}

This requirement is for physical and cyber security. It includes installing cameras and locks on racks.
Some of this such as Firewalls is already in the project plan but much of it is not.

Items already in the plan:
\begin{itemize}
\item Card access to server rooms.
\item Backup network in case main link fails (though the microwave link is a new addition ..)
\item Auditable process to handle onboarding/offboarding
\item Some cameras are in the project but not complete coverage.

\end{itemize}

We will do as requested and cost estimates are provided in \tabref{tab:firewalls}.

{\bf Important Note}: We shall ring fence the Camera in its own firewall with more restricted access than the restricted control network.
However we will treat it as a black box deliverable for this requirement. We shall not expect encryption of the internal disks of the camera system. Any perturbation to the camera system tends to extend the project baseline.

I am not sure how to cost signage and labeling as required in NIST 171 3.8.4 \footnote{\url{https://www.archives.gov/files/cui/20161206-cui-marking-handbook-v1-1.pdf}}
